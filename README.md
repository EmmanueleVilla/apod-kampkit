Sample app using KampKit and reduxkotlin to make a shared library between android, ios and react.

Still in progress and in a very very very early stage!

The shared library contains the business logic and -in the mainJS folder- the react application.
In the "app" module there is the android code
In the "ios" folder there is the xcode project
